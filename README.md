This repo was setup to provide two examples of files compressed using an early implemention of LZW. This uses an initial bits/code size of 9.

The goal is find a modern way of decoding these compressed files. The uncompressed versions of those files are also included for verification.

Ideally, a python function is created, using existing libary code, if available, that accepts the input _compressed files, and generates the associated uncompresed versions
